# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using K-means clustering
We started by selecting a random dataset available online and converting the raw data into a usable format. We then used the wcss technique to determine the optimal number of clusters for this project. Points were grouped  based on Euclidean distance and centroids. The for loop iterated 10 times to identify the best K value for this dataset.
5 clusters were suitable for this project

There are 2 key parameters for this dataset: annual income and spending score. A higher spending score indicates greater spending by that person.

After clustering, we generated a graph to visualize the results.
